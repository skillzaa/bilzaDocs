<h1>Core Props</h1>
<img src="../images/baseComp_props_2022_9_05.jpg" alt="">

<p>BaseComponent is mother of all components. Almost all of its properties and methods are present in its children (components). However every component is different and have different requirements. For example a line needs different variable than a rectangle, thus some of the properties of BaseComponent are not present in some of its children components. This is a chart of which property of BaseComponent is implemented in which component or not.</p>

<h1>Base Component</h1>

<p>BaseComponent is the Parent class for (almost) all components. 
It has following methods and public members thus every component has these methods and public members.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that though every component will have these properties and methods but they may not be implemented by the component. So it is upto the component to implement these properties and methods as desired OR use them according to the requirement of the component.</p>

<ol>
<h3><li>public xAlign :XAlignOpt;</li></h3>
<h3><li>public yAlign : YAlignOpt;</li></h3>
<p>We have 2 values xAlign , yAlign. These 2 classes are used to align the X and Y coordingates of a component. The options for these values are provided in XAlignOpt and YAlignOpt.</p>

<h3><li>public xRotate :XAlignOpt;</li></h3>
<h3><li>public yRotate :YAlignOpt;</li></h3>
//--We have 2 values xRotate and yRotate. These 2 classes are used to align the rotate X and rotate Y coordingates of a component


<h3><li>public readonly XAlignOpt :typeof XAlignOpt;</li></h3>
<h3><li>public readonly YAlignOpt :typeof YAlignOpt;</li></h3>
<p>The xAlign and xRotate options are provided by XAlignOpt where as the yAlign and yRotate options are provided by YAlignOpt  </p>

<h3><li>public readonly id :string;</li></h3>
<p>Every component has a random id</p>


<h3><li>public responsiveCoordinates : boolean;</li></h3>
<p>If  responsiveCoordinates = false the values of this.x and this.y will be considered as raw pixels and not percentages.

<h3><li>public responsivePadding : boolean;</li></h3>
<p>If  responsivePadding = false the values of paddings (Left,Right,Top and Bottom) will be considered as raw pixels and not percentages.

<h3><li>public responsiveDims : boolean;</li></h3>
<p>If  responsiveDims = false the values of width and height will be considered as raw pixels and not percentages.

//--The draw layer
public drawLayer : DrawLayer;

//--This will be set by the engine so do not touch it.
public alwaysOn: boolean;
public version :string;
// IMPLEMENTED IN ENGINE-- visible = false will not be drawn

//--implemented in Base Component but component creator has to implement it
public rotation :AniNumber;
//--implemented in Base Component but component creator has to implement it
public opacity :AniNumber;
//--The color prop points to the color of the main content
public color :AniColor;
//-- This will always be implemented in some special cases like text which uses fontSize this will represent fontSize. However this will be used in 100% of the components
public width :AniNumber; // no need to convert it into AniNoPers
//--same as width
public height :AniNumber;// no need to convert it into AniNoPers
//--this will come in handy during using the lib with gui and while making interactive tools.
